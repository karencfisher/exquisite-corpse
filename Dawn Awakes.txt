Dawn awakes,
her rosy tones of clouds,
birds greet her arrival
of what to be foretold
A world so strange, yet so familiar
Where the clouds dance and the sun is unclear

The trees whisper secrets to those who listen
And shadows come alive when the moon glistens
A land of wonder, where anything can be
Even impossible things are a
blessing, a curse, a pretense
of a new era?

We shiver with anticipation
Our breaths misting the air
In this moment of cosmic love
We wait for the universe to declare
Its secrets to us, in a language unknown
But our hearts beat with a rhythm of its own.
