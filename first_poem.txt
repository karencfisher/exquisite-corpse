A ray of the sun
passing through the clouds,
illuminate our hearts
let it burn away the doubts and fears
until only love remains undone.

We are sad, on grayer days
of our integrity
and so we make merry and feast
Where the waves whisper secrets to me
Of a land beyond the horizon's reach
Where the stars dance in a silver beach
