*****

<b>
Stirring the oceans into a frothy swoon.  

The stars are sprinkles on a cosmic cake,  
A celestial treat that we cannot fake. 

The sun is a blazing ball of fire,  
A radiant orb that never tires. 

But what of the
</b><br>
<i>entrance to the realms unborn?

Of selves untarnished by time and toil,  
worthiness of happiness and joy  
will they feel light and love?</i>
<b>  
Will they dance with the stars, or tangle with the trees,  
Will their hearts be set free, or forever bewitched with unease,  
The answers lie hidden, in the depths of the unknown,</b>  
<i>the oceans of sky withheld  
things only the whales know, and fish</i>  
<b>Tales of shipwrecks and lost treasures prized  
Echoes of mermaid songs that hypnotize  
Mysteries of the tides and their ebb and flow  
Silent whispers of creatures we'll never know
</b><br>
<i>alas, despite our endeavors.

In concupiscence of a days denouement</i>  
<b>As the sun sets and darkness proclaims.  
The night is young, our hearts are aflame,  
With the promise of adventure and no shame.  
We'll run wild, through the woods and the streams.</b>
