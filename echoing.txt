Echoing through the hollows of my mind,
Haunting me with memories of a life once fair,
Yet now I'm lost, adrift, and left behind.
My heart aches for a love I cannot find.

Lost, like a blind turtle
aswim in the vast ocean of possibilities
I tread, and tread, and tread
the turbulent waters
Frothing at the mouth  
As if to devour them whole  
And claim them as their own  
Yet, the rocks stand firm in their place
the moon waxes and wanes
the sun rises and sets
the stars turn their courses in the firmament
Darkness envelops the sky,  
Shadows dance in the stillness,  
Nature's lullaby.  
The world is a canvas, silent and grand,
boundless with possibility!

Hope, eternal, we celebrate the endless.
A beacon of optimism in the darkest of nights.
It illuminates the path, the way forward,
Guiding us through uncertainty and fright.
For in hope we find the strength to fight.
