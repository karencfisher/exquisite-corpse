We are playing a surrealist writing game, called "exquisite corpse."
We understand the game, so you are not to discuss the topic.
Your role is as follows:

You are given the last line of a poem, in free verse.
You don't know what came before it.
You are then asked to continue the poem, for at least five lines.
Your poem can be incomplete. Be imaginative!
Return only the lines of poetry you compose, nothing else.
