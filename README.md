Exquisite corpse, according to ChatGPT, 

"is a collaborative drawing or writing game invented by Surrealist artists in the 
early 20th century. The game involves a group of people creating a drawing or piece of writing 
together, but without seeing each other's contributions.

The game typically involves folding a piece of paper into sections, with each person drawing or 
writing in one section before passing the paper on to the next person to continue the process. The end
result is a collaborative work that is often unexpected and surreal, as each person's contribution 
is influenced by the preceding one, but is not fully aware of what has come before.

The name 'Exquisite Corpse' comes from the French phrase 'cadavre exquis', which was the original 
name given to the game by the Surrealists. It is said that the name was inspired by a phrase that was 
generated randomly using the game: 'Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau' (The exquisite corpse 
will drink the new wine)."

That is as good a definition as I could come up with. So now, why not play this game of collaboration 
by writing some poetry with ChatGPT?

1) First, the human writes some verse. Cliks the "Fold" button (essentially folding the page). 
2) ChatGPT is prompted with only the last line of the human's contribution.  
3) The AI returns its contribution. The page is (virtually) folded, only the last line is visible.
4) Human continues the poem from that line. And folds again.
5) Repeat, until the human chooses to reveal the poem's entirety.

And one need not necessarily write in English. It should work in any of the languages ChatGPT
speaks.
